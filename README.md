# Peptile method
I developed a method for converting a matrix into 2D-dataframe for convoluted neural network prediction.

Its permits deep-learning of peptide sequence linking the pattern containing amino-acid position and the physical parameter.

This program is constituted from 3 parts. 


## 1. Parameter set




## 2. Tile generator




## 3. DL prediction
