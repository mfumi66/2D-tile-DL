# Peptile method
I developed a method for converting a matrix into picture for convoluted neural network prediction.

Its permits deep-learning of peptide sequence linking the pattern containing amino-acid position and the physical parameter.

This program is constituted from 3 parts. 




## 1. Parameter set
For execute the parameter set program, .csv file of amino acid sequences and phisical parameters were prepared.
Finally you can get the .csv file as output, its uses for making the .png file in the next.


## 2. Tile generator
Tile generator makes a picture as .png file of peptide from an amino acid sequence-parameter matrix.
The pictures were sorted into One or Zero folder. Optionally it could be amplify the images by rotate-flip operation.


## 3. DL prediction
For the DL prediction, I prepared keras CNN method.
